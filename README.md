This is recent work I did to experiment with baseball statistics, player info, and building SQL databases from scratch. 
There are two kinds of tables created that produce the same results.
The separate tables receive info from the four databases and place them in one query to complete a task. 
The joined tables are for the compiled databases that use "all_hitter_data" and "all_pitcher_data" which combines the schools, players, and season stats into one database.
